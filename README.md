A	Excellent
B	Very Good
C	Good
D	Average
E	Need to Improve

NoOfMonths and DaysOfWeek
Both NoOfMonths and DaysOfWeek classes take a number as input and return a corresponding month or day of the week.

2	February
3	March
4	April
5	May
6	June
7	July
8	August
9	September
10	October
11	November
12	December

Any other number	Invalid Input
Usage
To use these programs, simply compile and run them using the javac and java commands.

For example, to compile and run GradeEvaluator, use the following commands:
javac GradeEvaluator.java
java GradeEvaluator
Then, enter a single character when prompted to get the corresponding grade.

To compile and run NoOfMonths or DaysOfWeek, use the following commands:

javac NoOfMonths.java
java NoOfMonths
javac DaysOfWeek.java
java DaysOfWeek
Then, enter a number when prompted to get the corresponding month or day of the week.

Conclusion
These simple Java programs demonstrate how to take user input and return corresponding values based on that input. They can be used as a starting point for more complex programs that require user input and output.

Happy coding!
